# Telco Customer Churn Prediction 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and builds machine learning models to predict **customer churn** using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for subscription-based businesses.  
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the Telco dataset.
- Engineer useful features.
- Train multiple machine learning models.
- Combine them into a **Voting Classifier** for improved performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib
